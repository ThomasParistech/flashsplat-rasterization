# FlashSplat Rasterization

**NOTE**: this is a modified version from original 3DGS code to support instant 3DGS Segmentation.


Used as the rasterization engine for the paper "FlashSplat: 2D to 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation Solved Optimally". 

If you can make use of it in your own research, please be so kind to cite us.
